Cradlepoint NetCloud Manager (NCM) is an SaaS-type server that enables the remote management of network devices, including routers and access points.

What is a REST API?
An API, or application programming interface, is a protocol that enables communication between different software systems. APIs provide the building blocks programmers need to create applications that access the data from a software platform â€“ in this case the data from Cradlepoint NetCloud Manager.

REST, or representational state transfer, is a particular architectural style, common for Web APIs, that leverages existing technologies of the Web (e.g. HTTP, XML) to enable information access on a large scale. The REST architecture was first described by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation.

A REST API is a hypertext-driven API that uses HTTP methods and follows the REST principles. The Cradlepoint NetCloud Manager REST API uses the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
